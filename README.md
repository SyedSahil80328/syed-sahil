# Welcome üëã

Hi! I‚Äôm **Syed Sahil**, a passionate **Software Developer** who enjoys building applications - sometimes out of necessity, sometimes purely for fun. My interests span **Web Development** and **Artificial Intelligence**, and I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly solutions.

This repository holds my **first GitHub Pages deployment**, a milestone where I learned not just how to host a website from source code, but also how to manage versions effectively on GitHub.
