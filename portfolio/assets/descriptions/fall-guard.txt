FallGuard is a fall detection system built to overcome key limitations of vision-based approaches, such as privacy concerns and camera blind spots. It leverages wearable sensor data to provide accurate and real-time fall detection, offering a reliable alternative in both indoor and outdoor settings.
The system utilizes triaxial accelerometer signals from wearable devices, augmented using SMOTE to address class imbalance. It employs an enhanced InceptionTimePlus architecture tailored for time series classification, capturing subtle temporal dynamics associated with fall events.
FallGuard achieved a classification accuracy of 98.84% and a fooling rate of 96.29%, outperforming four established deep learning baselines. Its strong performance and generalizability make it well-suited for integration into healthcare monitoring systems.
