<strong>Employer Name:</strong> Capital Educational and Charitable Trust
As a freelancer and team lead, I led the implementation of a full-stack application for the trust, focusing on both front-end and back-end development.
I designed and developed a responsive website tailored to the trustâ€™s informational and usability needs, ensuring smooth user experience and efficient data handling through PHP and MySQL.
Development was carried out using VS Code, with XAMPP and PhpMyAdmin used for local server testing and database management, resulting in a smooth deployment and client satisfaction.
