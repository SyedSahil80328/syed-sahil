I am a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in application development, testing, time series analysis, AI, and hardware-integrated systems. Skilled in Swift, Java, Kotlin, C++, and Python, I have a solid foundation in data structures and problem-solving, and experience building responsive, high-performance applications for mobile and web platforms.
I have contributed to projects such as Norton VPN and SafeSocial at Gen Digital, as well as NavAid at Anna University, gaining expertise in clean UI design, unit testing, and real-time system deployment. My work emphasizes performance optimization, design compliance, and effective team collaboration.
With a focus on clean design principles, strong communication, and user-centered development, I aim to create scalable, impactful solutions at the intersection of application development, testing, and intelligent systems.
