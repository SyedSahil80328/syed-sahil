<strong>Employer Name:</strong> Centre for Sponsored Research and Consultancy, Anna University
As a fellowship intern and team vice leader, I collaborated on the implementation, configuration, and documentation of an assistive navigation system aimed at helping the visually impaired.
We built <strong>NavAid</strong>, a real-time voice-guided system capable of detecting 91 object classes with 98.63% accuracy. I was involved in hardware procurement, Raspberry Pi setup, and peripheral integration.
The project featured dual-mode navigation using GPS and an offline fallback powered by LangChain. I also contributed to the documentation process, capturing development and workflow stages with technical figures.
<strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, YOLO, Haar Cascades, LangChain, pyttsx3
