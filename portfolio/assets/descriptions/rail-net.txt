Streamlining railway operations through smart technology: This web application was developed to efficiently manage train schedules and over 100 booking records with a focus on security and usability. The platform ensures authenticated access to sensitive operations and ticketing functions, tailored for administrative control and user convenience.
The system leverages Flask for backend routing and session management, MySQL for structured data storage, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive front-end interface. Secure transactions and login processes were reinforced using Triple DES (TDES) encryption. The backend logic followed Object-Oriented Programming principles, enabling scalable and maintainable code.
Key features include automated PDF ticket generation for every booking and real-time voice alerts to guide users through the interface, both of which enhanced overall usability. During testing, the solution performed successfully across 90% of scenarios, demonstrating its reliability in real-world conditions.
