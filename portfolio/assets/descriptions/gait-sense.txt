GaitSense is a drift-aware classification system designed to identify temporal distribution shifts in gait signals, particularly those linked to freezing episodes in Parkinsonian movement. It addresses a significant 43.35% classification accuracy drop typically caused by such shifts in time series data.
The model architecture integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to classify drifts detected using a Bayesian change detector. The input comprises triaxial accelerometer signals, allowing fine-grained temporal pattern recognition.
Tested on the Daphnet Freezing of Gait dataset, GaitSense outperformed three state-of-the-art drift detectors, achieving 96.9% classification accuracy and a 92.3% fooling rate, demonstrating its robustness in dynamic and high-noise environments.
